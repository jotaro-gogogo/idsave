# IdSave
This app receives an image followed by a side note and a category, then stores it into a database.  
Such database is then transformed into a CSV file and stored into my Dropbox folder to use it in another OS.  
It now reduces the image size to a minimum of 720px and converts it into a JPG file.

I made this app just to manage and keep in order my ideas for future projects.
